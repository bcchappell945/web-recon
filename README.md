# web-recon
This repo contains a bash script I made that is a part of the TCM Security Practical Bug Bounty Course!

# Purpose
This tool is used to fuzz and find subdomains, put them into a human-readable list, and then perform a scan for open ports on the webserver corresponding to the subdomains.

# Requirements
This script requires the following tools to run:
- subfinder
- assetfinder
- httprobe
- gowitness
- nmap

# Usage
This script is for use of performing allowed and permitted automated scanning of a website. To use this tool, run `./recon.sh <Website>`
